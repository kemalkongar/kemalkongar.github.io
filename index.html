    <p>As you can tell, I'm not a big fan of slow websites with tons of images and styling when the aim is to convey
        information and not to market a product. <br>No, I don't claim to be a particularly gifted web developer or
        designer.</p>
    <p>If you think this website is too simplistic, you should take a look at <a
